Wouldn't it be nice if we could get the location via WIFI spots that are more available than other alternatives?

Wouldn't it be awful if we encounter a security vulnerability in Redpin?

There is an opportunity for integrating the Redpin server with the cloud, minimizing the setup needed to be done by event organizers.
